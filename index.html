  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Ronald Taylor, I'm 37 years old and I'm excited to learn about coding.  I have a great understanding of how computer hardware works, but now I want learn about the software side.
    I've always enjoyed computers, but mostly on the hardware side.  I've upgraded stored bought computers since I was 16 and built the last 3 PC's I've owned.  I took a programming class about 10 years ago while at Coastal Community College.  
    For the last 11 years I've worked on the production floor of Fleet Readiness Center East as a production controller ordering aircraft components.  With the onset of COVID and the possibility of home schooling my son I decided it was time for a career change.
